# Data Visualisation

## Background information

At GE, we use many different styles of visualization charts to make decisions based off real time data. Most importantly, we use data visualization to ensue quality control in our manufacturing process and to determine if the parts we manufacture are made accurately.

When thinking about data visualization, we use Run Charts and KPIs:

- A Run Chart is a line graph that is plotted over time. Run Charts are considered time series charts, they are used to plot data points (typically) over a given time frame. This helps us to track how our manufacturing process is performing over time as our machinery ages.
- KPI are values calculated such that use a single number to give insight to the performance of a process (is it behaving expected range). This helps us to quickly and efficiently make decisions around what improvements we can make in our process.

## Tasks

When our parts are manufactured, individual design attributes are machined into each part as it goes down the assembly line. This results in a finished part. This is called an operation.

Think, a part can start out as a block of metal and through manufacturing operations, this block will become a useable part. After each operation, there is an expected nominal measurement of the design attribute that we record in manufacturing records. This is to ensure each part is made the same and will fit its required purpose.

There is also an acceptable tolerance (how far off the measurement is allowed) from that nominal value.

We have supplied a dataset that is ready to be visualized in the resources section below. Your task is to create a run chart using Tableau that will visualize the measurement of a given feature of each operation for a given part number.

We need to identify whether the measurement is in or out of a given specification of that given feature (required design attribute) to showcase to your supply chain management team on how the manufacturing process is performing.

Take screenshots of your workings in Tableau, return to this page and upload your findings in section 5 below to view the sample solution.

We've included some useful materials and hints to help get you started in the resources section below. We recommend you take a look at these materials before getting started!

You can also develop some interesting data dashboards that give you insights about the Flight Data Tables.

For fun - you can use the destination_latitude and destination_longitude for mapping; otherwise, general graphs representing different relationships will be fine!
